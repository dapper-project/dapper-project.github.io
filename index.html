<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>
Dapper transforms a live process's state for different purposes. For example, Dapper supports
live process migration of natively compiled Linux binaries across servers with CPUs of different architectures.
It also support re-randomizing the stack and registers of a process to improve security.

    Dapper was built on top of <a href="https://criu.org/Main_Page">CRIU</a> to dump
    a running process and then transform the <a href="https://criu.org/Images">CRIU images</a> to support restoration on servers of a different architecture.
    Currently, Dapper supports process migration on <code>x86-64</code> and <code>aarch64</code> CPUs.

Dapper uses LLVM's stack maps to generate stack and register metadata and implements a stack and register transformation logic leveraging the generated metadata. It does this on CRIU dumped images and hence does not involve injecting transformation runtime within the binary image improving security.
<p>
This repository provides the CRIU wrapper and the compiler toolchain can be found on this branch of the popcorn compiler repository.
